👋 Hi, I’m **@artofstock**  
👀 I’m passionate about the stock market, quantitative research, and AI-driven trading.  
🌱 I’m currently studying machine learning and applying it to real-world trading logic, especially in building automated stock and ELW trading systems.  

📈 Recently, I’ve been working on:  
• Developing ML-driven strategies that detect reliable bottoms and trend shifts  
• Designing automated trading logic with reduced user intervention  
• Exploring RSI-based and volatility-adaptive indicators tailored for ELW trading  
• Visualizing real-time market data with custom charts, signals, and analytics  
• Experimenting with clustering methods and pattern analysis to improve prediction models  
• Studying lightweight architectures for fully automated trading bots  

🤖 I enjoy combining data science, algorithmic trading, and system automation to create smarter tools like **Atlas Stock Tool**, a project inspired by my ongoing research.
